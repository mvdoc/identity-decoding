## [TITLE]

This repository contains the code for the analyses reported in *[TITLE]* by Matteo Visconti di Oleggio Castello, James V. Haxby, & M. Ida Gobbini.

**DISCLAIMER** These scripts are shared in a format that is suitable for archival and review. All analyses were run inside a singularity container (shared in the current repository) on a local cluster and on [Discovery, Dartmouth's HPC cluster](rc.dartmouth.edu). The paths listed in these scripts need to be modified in order to run the scripts on a different system.

**If you have any questions related to the code, please open an issue in this repository.**
